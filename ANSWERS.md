- [ ] Why do we write tests for our apps?
Testing is critical, particularly in large applications, for example when changes are made it can cause other areas of an appication to break as a side effect and testing would indicate where each break occured - removing the need for fine tooth coming which is time consuming. Testing also confirms each step along the way that each piece of the app is working as it's developed, lastly testing is useful for simulating users actually interfacing with the app and 
gives feedback on the apps behavior - indicating edge case behaviors that need to be addressed
and removing the need for expensive beta testing by actual people.
